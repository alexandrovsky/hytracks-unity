		<h1>uPI(e) Menu Documentation</h1>
		Thanks for choosing uPI(e) Menu - a professional and highly customizable unity asset, made to create radial menus tailored to your needs fast and easily.
		<h2>Getting started</h2>
		The uPI(e) Menu asset comes with several example scenes which should be self explenatory and can show you how to create different types of radial menus with different options set up.
		However this chapter is intendet to show how to set up a new uPI(e) Menu from scratch and explain what each of the different options means.
		First of all you need to create a <strong>new canvas</strong> for Unity3Ds new UI system to be drawn at. So After creating a new project in unity right click in the Hierarchy window and choose <strong>UI -> Canvas</strong>. Two new GameObjects should be created: one is called <em>"Canvas"</em> the other <em>"EventSystem"</em>. Right click on the object called <em>"Canvas"</em> and choose <strong>Create Empty</strong>. A new GameObject will be created as a child of <em>"Canvas"</em>. Rename the newly created object to <em>"uPIeMenu"</em> (or some other name you'd like it to be called). Now select the uPIeMenu object and press the <strong>Add Component</strong> Button in the inspector. Type in <em>uPIeMenu</em> and add the component. The newly added component should look like this:<br />
		<p><center><img src="pics/inspctor_view_empty.png"><br />"Empty" inspector view</img></center></p><br />
		One of the nice things about working with uPI(e) is that the inspector only shows the options to you that you currently need. By default the inspector looks pretty basic but it expands if you need more specific options. Additionally pretty much every option has a tooltip. So if you hover over an options name a tooltip will pop up explaining what this option means - so you could start using to work with uPI(e) immediately. But if you want to read about some theory first, the next section is going to explain what each option does in detail.<br />
		<h2>Component options in detail</h2>
		As stated before the inspector for uPI(e) expands daynamically, so that users don't get overwhelmed by options they don't actually need. The following imge shows how the inspector looks like, when it's fully expanded:
		<p><center><img src="pics/inspctor_view_full.png"><br />Expanded inspector view</img></center></p><br />
		The first option labeled with <strong>Control With</strong> sets up what input type you are going to use this menu with. This basically means you are using a mouse (or more generally a pointer) that is located with pixel coordinates on the screen.
		In contrast to that, the option <em>Gamepad</em> means you are using an analog (or the digipad if you like) stick to control the menu with. Like any other option of the uPIeMenu you can also change this during runtime.<br /><br />
		If you set the menu to be controlled with the gamepad two more fields will pop up underneath <strong>Input System</strong> named <em>Horizontal Input Name</em> and <em>Vertical Input Name</em>.
		<strong>Input System</strong> is set to <em>Unity Default</em> by default. This means, that the input system delivered by unity is used as the source to retrieve input data from. You can access the input manager via <em>Edit -> Project Settings -> Input</em> and adjust these settings to your needs (for more information see <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html" target="_blank">Unity Input Manager Documentation</a>).
		You can than link the axis from the input manager with uPI(e) Menu, by simply fill in the names of the axis or buttons you want to use in the appropriate fields in the uPIeMenu component under <em>Input System</em>.<br />
		If you change the input system from <em>Unity Default</em> to <em>Custom</em> uPI(e) Menu will no longer react to unitys input system, but you now have full control over it. If you want to use your own custom or any kind of 3rd party input system you can set the input value directly from script, by changing the value of the <em>CustomInput</em> property. Also check the <em>Demo Custom Input</em> scene to see a basic use of custom input.<br />
		By default the first option/ piece of uPI(e) Menu will trigger, when aiming in the north of the circle and each other option will be set next to the previous one in a clockwise order. You can adjust the starting point by changing the <strong>Degrees Offset</strong> option. The starting point is displayed as a green line in the scene view.<br /><br />
		The option <strong>Circle Size</strong> gives you control over how "full" the uPI(e) Menu is. You can either choose one of the most common ones from the popup (full circle, three-fourth circle, semi circle and quater circle) or you can set the size of the circle in degrees, by pressing the <strong>Set Value</strong> button.<br />
		Under the section <strong>Menu Options</strong> you can set up all the radial menus "pieces". This means you can set up each of the selectables which represent one part of the menu. A new menu has no menu options - to create one click the <strong>Add Menu Option</strong> button. A new gameobject will be created as a child of the gameobject holding the uPIeMenu script. By default this new gameobject holds a button component - but you can use any kind of <em>UnityEngine.UI.Selectable</em> and replace the menu option with it.<br />
		The "-" button removes the related gameobject and the menu option, whereas the red longish button labeled <strong>Clear</strong> removes all menu options.<br />
		You can also set up a default option for your menu. The default option is the option, that is automatically selected when you don't move your analog stick far enough when using a gamepad. The <strong>Controller Deadzone</strong> value sets up how much the analog stick has to be moved before deselecting the default option. If you use a mouse (or an other pointing device) as a controlling device, the rest of the menu logic will not react, as long as this option is selected. This just means when hovering the default option with your mouse no other option will be selected until you leave the default option again. This also makes it easy to creaty a pie menu with a "hole" in the middle by placing an invisible button (or other selectable) in the middle of the menu and linking it to the default field.<br />
		The <strong>Indicator settings</strong> let you set up an indicator. An indicator is a graphic that shows you what option is currently selected. It points in the direction of your mouse or your analog stick. When using an indicator graphic you can set up if the indicator should face this direction (then transform.right should point in this direction) or just stand still.<p /><br />
		Under the section <strong>Alignment helper</strong> your are provided with a tool helping you to align all the menu options nice, properly and easily. You can specify by which <em>radius</em> the menu options should be aligned and whether or not the rotation of each menu option should also be considered. You can also specify how the rotation is defined, by setting up a specific <em>up - and forward direction</em>.
		The <strong>Debug Options</strong> can help you align your menu options or find issues with your menu setup.
